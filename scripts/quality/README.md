# Quality Scripts

## Scripts
- `scripts/quality/run-smoke-tests.ps1`
  - Runs the curated fast smoke suite from the explicit `Category=Smoke` test set in the maintained smoke projects.
  - Default output: `artifacts/test-results/smoke/`
- `scripts/quality/run-blocking-tests.ps1`
- Runs the required CI-safe non-Docker lane against the platform-only `Incursa.OpenAI.Agents.slnx`.
  - Default output: `artifacts/test-results/blocking/`
- `scripts/quality/run-observational-tests.ps1`
  - Runs `Category=KnownIssue` tests without blocking the overall process.
  - Default output: `artifacts/test-results/observational/`
- `scripts/quality/run-advisory-quality-tests.ps1`
  - Produces advisory TRX and curated Cobertura evidence without syncing Workbench.
  - Default outputs: `artifacts/test-results/advisory/` and `artifacts/coverage/advisory/`
- `scripts/quality/run-quality-evidence.ps1`
  - Runs the advisory lane, syncs Workbench quality evidence, and shows the latest advisory report.
  - Default outputs: `artifacts/test-results/advisory/`, `artifacts/coverage/advisory/`, and `artifacts/quality/testing/`
- `scripts/quality/run-workbench-evidence.ps1`
  - Compatibility entrypoint that forwards to the advisory evidence runner.
  - Default outputs: `artifacts/test-results/advisory/` and `artifacts/coverage/advisory/`
- `scripts/quality/run-library-coverage.ps1`
  - Runs package-level unit coverage gates for configurable targets.
  - Supports line threshold, optional branch threshold, and custom output roots.
- `scripts/quality/run-library-mutation.ps1`
  - Runs required mutation configs for the public packages in this repo.
- `scripts/quality/validate-library-traceability.ps1`
  - Verifies that `LIB-*` scenario IDs in specs are fully represented in the library conformance matrix.
  - Validates matrix mapped file paths for `Covered` rows, including PublicAPI baseline references for `PublicApi` coverage rows.

## Workbench Quality Workflow
- Canonical contract: `docs/30-contracts/test-gate.contract.yaml`
- Smoke: `pwsh -File scripts/quality/run-smoke-tests.ps1`
- Blocking: `pwsh -File scripts/quality/run-blocking-tests.ps1`
- Observational: `pwsh -File scripts/quality/run-observational-tests.ps1`
- Generate advisory evidence: `pwsh -File scripts/quality/run-advisory-quality-tests.ps1`
- One-command advisory sync/show: `pwsh -File scripts/quality/run-quality-evidence.ps1`
- Normalize evidence manually: `dotnet tool run workbench quality sync --contract docs/30-contracts/test-gate.contract.yaml --results artifacts/test-results/advisory --coverage artifacts/coverage/advisory --out-dir artifacts/quality/testing`
- Inspect the current report: `dotnet tool run workbench quality show`
- Derived outputs: `artifacts/quality/testing/`
